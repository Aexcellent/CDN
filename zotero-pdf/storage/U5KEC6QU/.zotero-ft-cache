Abstract 
 
This work focuses on a particular node of the intermodal chain of transportation, i.e. the maritime port area that represents the link between rail and sea transportation modes. Since this exchange node of the chain has not been addressed much yet, the aim of the present study is to provide a description of the process of rail operations in port area, to give an overview of the optimization challenges and to review the existing literature on it. The purpose of the paper is to attract the researchers attention on this particular intermodal node, where there is room for improvements.
