Abstract 
 
Due to the collective attention towards global environmental challenges, the rise in fuel prices, the risk of drivers’ shortage, and the new legal developments limiting the hours of service on frequently congested roads, developing efficient and effective intermodal freight transport networks is becoming an increasingly important success factor for companies to manage their supply chains. However, many factors hinder the smooth implementation of intermodal systems, such as the high number of operators to be involved, the duplication of handling activities and transit times at the intersection of each transport mode, and the lack of information sharing among the different transport modes and companies. To overcome such barriers, Intelligent Communication Systems (ICS) have increasingly been applied to activities within the nodes (warehouses, transit points) and arches (transport routes) of distribution networks, providing several benefits, such as real-time visibility and tracking, more precise, reliable and efficient data collection, and document exchange. One of the key elements that can guarantee the successful design and implementation of an intermodal transport system is the integration of the various systems and actors involved along the process. This paper aims to contribute to this issue by presenting some of the results of the “ITS Italy 2020” project, an applied research initiative financed by the Italian Government to foster the diffusion of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). More specifically, we illustrate a prototype solution, based on a software that allows managing and monitoring freight transport along an intermodal network, thus overcoming some barriers currently limiting intermodal transport implementation. The prototype can communicate with devices and sensors put on board the vehicle or load, and track sensors positioned along the road. The solution integrates all the other systems involved by collecting and publishing information, managing events, and sending messages.
