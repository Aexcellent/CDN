Abstract 
 
In this paper we review the dry port concept and its outfalls in terms of optimal design and management of freight distribution. Some optimization challenges arising from the presence of dry ports in intermodal freight transport systems are presented and discussed. Then we consider the tactical planning problem of defining the optimal routes and schedules for the fleet of vehicles providing transportation services between the terminals of a dry-port-based intermodal system. An original service network design model based on a mixed integer programming mathematical formulation is proposed to solve the considered problem. An experimental framework built upon realistic instances inspired by regional cases is described and the computational results of the model are presented and discussed.
