Although the technology has been widely successful in the financial sector, it is still novel in the maintenance field. Given the customized nature of maintenance processes, it is unclear if a suitable consensus protocol can be identified that can enhance trust among stakeholders. This problem is investigated through the lens of the Design Science Research Methodology. First, the theoretical background of blockchain technology and its role in enhancing trust are explained, followed by the analysis of a current case at a Railway company to test the proof of concept. A business network archive is developed for the maintenance management of the sliding step of the train door system. The archive encompasses the business logic and transactional data required to enhance trust among stakeholders in the quality of performed maintenance. The developed archive is deployed on Hyperledger Fabric and the effectiveness of the solution is evaluated through a survey. The results show that the developed business network, deployed on a customized Hyperledger Fabric consensus protocol, enhanced trust among the stakeholders involved.\n\n1. Introduction\nManaging information among stakeholders with different interests is a challenge faced by academics, scientists, and businesses alike. In the transportation industry, for instance, managing asset maintenance in­ formation is a sensitive problem (Faiz & Edirisinghe, 2009; Gerardo & Bryant, 2006). In such contexts, stakeholders face difficulties in sharing critical asset information because of a lack of trust. Trust is also considered a key influencing factor for knowledge sharing in the liter­ ature on knowledge management (Politis, 2003), project management (Park & Lee, 2014), and decision support systems (Chiu, Hsu, & Wang, 2006). Ensuring trust in a multi-stakeholder setting is particularly difficult, as trust falls in the category of beliefs, which largely exist in tacit form. The literature acknowledges the distinct challenges associ­ ated with explicit and tacit knowledge sharing (Hau, Kim, Lee, & Kim, 2013), and specifically highlights the difficulty of sharing tacit knowl­ edge because of its embodied nature (Nonaka, 1994). In contrast, sharing explicit knowledge is considered easier because it is, by nature,\n\nreadily articulated, codified, stored, and accessed (H´elie & Sun, 2010). Additionally, modern Information Technology (IT)-driven knowledge management systems used by organizations today have contributed significantly to optimizing explicit knowledge sharing. The challenge, however, is sharing explicit knowledge between stakeholders such that it addresses the underlying tacit assumptions. In addition to this, Pan, Pan, Song, Ai, and Ming (2020) stress the need to introduce trust mechanisms in organisations to solve the problem of trust to improve information and knowledge sharing which plays a central role in the long term stable enterprise development.\nBuilding trust in asset maintenance information among stakeholders with different, and often divergent, interests is a challenging task. In­ formation authenticity and integrity are key areas of concern in such situations (Li, Sampigethaya, & Poovendran, 2010), and the sharing of inaccurate or unreliable maintenance information can lead to mistrust among stakeholders and slow down maintenance processes. Moreover, it can also influence maintenance effectiveness, as trust fosters “successful cooperation and effectiveness in organizations” (Six, 2007).

Abbas et al.\nrequires great care, though, as acquiring data about assets is not always considered useful or cost-effective (Garg & Deshmukh, 2006; Moubray, 1992; Smith, 2002). Moreover, human factors play a central role in the overall quality of the acquired information (Murphy, 2009). Therefore, designing information management solutions that can appeal to the tacit needs of users is fundamental to enhancing trust in the quality of shared information.\nAs pointed out by several authors (Perera, Nanayakkara, Rodrigo, Senaratne, & Weinand, 2020; Viriyasitavat, Da Xu, Bi, & Sapsomboon, 2019), the distinct features of Blockchain Technology (BT) seem to provide a unique opportunity to facilitate the building of trust among stakeholders with different interests. Similarly, BT is presented as a technological solution for generating trustworthy relationships (Wamba & Queiroz, 2020). However, Hughes et al. (2019) mention that resis­ tance among users due to poor levels of knowledge and trust in tech­ nology could pose threats to wider acceptance of BT in the organisational setting. Moreover, Di Vaio and Varriale (2020) state that existing literature does not provide significant knowledge about the implications of BT for future industries especially its practical applica­ tion and effects on operations management. Consequently, this paper explores the potential of BT in enhancing trust among the stakeholders responsible for the maintenance of rolling stock in a case at Netherlands Railways (principal railway operator in the Netherlands) hereon referred to as Railway company. The developed BT solution is tested on a specific component - the sliding step - of the train door system used in Railway company rolling stock. This paper attempts to enhance trust in the quality of performed maintenance among stakeholders by investi­ gating the following research question.\nHow can blockchain technology be used to enhance trust in the quality of performed maintenance among stakeholders?\nHevner, March, Park, and Ram (2004) state that one of the most significant characteristics of a sound study is that it must produce an “artefact created to address a problem”. The Design Science Research Methodology (DSMR) developed by Peffers, Tuunanen, Rothenberger, and Chatterjee (2007) for design science research on information sys­ tems was used for this study, which aims to explore the potential of BT with regard to enhancing trust among stakeholders. It is a suitable fit for this study, as it helps create desired artefacts and has also been previ­ ously used within the railway sector (Otto & Ofner, 2010).\nThe rest of the paper is structured around the guidelines of the DSMR methodology. First, the state of the art of BT is presented in Section 2.1. Next, the description of the Railway company case with trust-related issues is provided in Section 2.2 to show a practical use case for the proof of concept. Subsequently, the developed solution is presented in Section 3 to address the research question and produce an artefact for the chosen use case. The objectives of the desired solution are outlined in Section 3.1, which are determined by analysing the qualitative data gathered from persona templates and formulated user stories. Similarly, the design and development part of the solution is described in Section 3.2 and its evaluation is provided in Section 3.3. Subsequently, Section 4 discusses the key insights gained from the study, the appropriateness of the proposed approach, and key areas for improvement in the developed solution. Section 5 presents the key implications and recommendations from the conducted research for business and academics. Last, section 6 concludes the study and highlights key areas for future research.\n2. Background of the study\nThis section presents the state of the art of BT and describes the case of the Fast Light Innovative Regional Train (FLIRT) sliding step to show the core issues regarding maintenance management for this part.\n2.1. BT: state of the art\nThis section details the state of the art of BT and its key applications. As highlighted by Lu (2018b, 2019) blockchain, decentralized\n\nInternational Journal of Information Management 55 (2020) 102228\ninfrastructure and distributed general ledger agreement, is highly suit­ able for establishing data security and trust for automation and intelli­ gence development. The first successful application of BT was the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008). Ever since its intro­ duction, it has proven to be a robust technology with beneficial attri­ butes that stretch far beyond cryptocurrency. Palm, Bodin, and Schel´en (2020) point out that ever since the Bitcoin introduction different Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as R3 Corda, Hyperledger Fabrik, and Ethereum have made the BT useful for not just financial world but also contractual cooperation. Iansiti and Lakhani (2017) describe blockchain as “an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way”. At its core, BT is a combination of old technologies, such as cryptography and peer-to-peer networks. So far, BT has pri­ marily impacted the financial sector, but it has the potential to revolu­ tionize many industries. It is being tested in many fields, ranging from retail and customer goods to healthcare and food industry (Bum­ blauskas, Mann, Dugan, & Rittmer, 2019). Nonetheless, Yli-Huumo, Ko, Choi, Park, and Smolander (2016) state that over 80 % of the papers on the topic of blockchain are on the Bitcoin system, and less than 20 % deal with other blockchain applications. In contrast to the overwhelming majority of research on BT, this paper explores and investigates how BT can be useful in the management of asset maintenance information.\nBlockchain provides a platform that ensures authenticity, security, confidentiality, and room for customization in the context of informa­ tion management (Lu, 2018a). This is primarily made possible by the three key features of blockchain technology: the ledger (which records all transactions based on the defined protocol); encryption (which pro­ tects the ledger from tampering); and distributed redundant storage (which can identify changes to the ledger). These three features provide users with a higher degree of confidence in the authenticity and security of their data (Benkler, 2016). They also provide flexibility and make it possible to orchestrate the stored information such that organizations can incorporate their business logic and develop their own blockchain applications (Brill et al., 2013). As shown by Viriyasitavat, Da Xu, Bi, Hoonsopon, and Charoenruk (2019); Da Xu and Viriyasitavat (2019) blockchain and smart contracts are two key enabler technologies for establishing trust in entities involved in a business process.\nSeebacher and Schüritz (2017), while describing the functioning of BT, state that it is a shared distributed database in a peer-to-peer network which “consists of a linked sequence of blocks (a storage unit of a transaction), holding timestamped transactions that are secured by public-key cryptography (i.e., “hash”) and verified by the network community. Once an element is appended to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, turning a blockchain into an immutable record of past activity”. This makes it a technology with far-reaching implications for gover­ nance, management, and decision-making (Davidson, De Filippi, & Potts, 2016). Blockchain’s ability to remove intermediaries gives users ownership of and control over their own data (Back, Corallo, & Dashjr, 2014; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017). BT addresses trust between participants, as it requires confirmation of each requested transaction through decentralized consensus (Back et al., 2014). Similarly, Hughes et al. (2019) point out that blockchain effectively replaces trust in humans with trust in technology through verification and associated protocols. In their systematic review, Ali, Ally, Clutterbuck, and Dwivedi (2020) also report trust as a key benefit of implementing blockchain and present it as a technology that gives its user confidence that the archived in­ formation has not been altered. BT ensures trust by following a struc­ tured approach where immutable blocks are chronologically added to form a chain of blocks through an agreement process commonly known as consensus in the chain. Different algorithms have been developed to achieve consensus in BT. Consensus forms an agreed truth among all stakeholders and eventually adds trust in the shared information (Bod­ khe et al., 2020). The selection of appropriate consensus algorithms based on contextual needs is crucial to developing effective blockchain solutions. A comprehensive survey of blockchain-based consensus\n\n2\n\nY. Abbas et al.\nalgorithms and their application in the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) such as Intelligent Transportation has been presented by Bodkhe et al. (2020).\nBrill et al. (2013) underline five key attributes of blockchain tech­ nology: it is distributed and sustainable; secure and indelible; trans­ parent and auditable; consensus-based and transactional, and flexible and orchestrated. Although blockchains are distributed databases controlled by a group of individuals, who store and share the agreed upon information, they can be classified into the following three main types: public, private, and federated or consortium blockchains (Lau­ rence, 2017). This classification is based on factors such as ownership, access, transaction speed, security, and identity. This diversity facilitates testing blockchain in a broad range of sectors. Additionally, Helliar, Crawford, Rocca, Teodori, and Veneziani (2020) highlight that although permissioned blockchains are not as widespread as permissionless blockchain they are increasingly becoming an institutional-driven so­ lution to conduct businesses with transactional efficiency. BT is being tested in industries such as media and music, transportation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and supply chain management. Outlier Ventures, a corporate research tracker, reported blockchain activity at about 285 companies in January 2018. According to Ashley Lannquist (2018), around 140 of those companies have been experimenting with block­ chain technology for proof of concept.\nThe blockchain applications used in these sectors are most likely a sign of things to come, as, according to a survey conducted by the World Economic Forum in 2015, it is estimated that 10 % of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be stored on blockchain by 2027 (World Economic Forum, 2015). Its industrial applications range from social applications to the banking sector (Hassani, Huang, & Silva, 2018; Viriyasitavat, Da Xu, Bi, & Pungpapong, 2019). This shows the key role that BT will play in the near future. However, several legitimate chal­ lenges require further research within the domain of BT, such as throughput and latency issues, size and bandwidth issues, and usability and wasted resources issues (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Similarly, Ying, Jia, and Du (2018) underline that discussions on BT are mostly on conceptual expositions and empirical evidence on how to use the tech­ nology is limited. The use of BT for maintenance is relatively new, and only a few projects in this sphere were identified in the study on BT applications. These include projects such as Blockchain for Aviation (BC4A) by Lufthansa; Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) by BMW, Ford, General Motors and Renault; and several studies conducted by Airbus (Allison, 2018; Evers, 2016). Most of these projects are in their pilot phase, and there is not much academic literature on blockchain-enabled maintenance.\nAcknowledging Bodkhe et al. (2020); Capobianco (2018); and Hughes et al. (2019) claim that blockchain provides trust in transactions and the suggestion that it assists decision-making through decentralized consensus by Back et al. (2014), this study explores the potential use of BT for managing asset maintenance information. More specifically, it explores the potential use case at the Railway company as proof of concept, where the right decisions need to be taken promptly to avoid domino effects and major disruptions in the intrinsic density of the network.\n2.2. Description of the Railway company case\nAsset maintenance information includes, but is not limited to, maintenance event registration, maintenance guidelines, technical specifications, and the performance data of the asset. Effective man­ agement of such information can play a key role in designing better assets, improving asset maintenance guidelines, and optimization of asset maintenance plans. However, conflicting interests coupled with trust issues regarding maintenance information hinder the improvement of asset maintenance management.\nA suitable use case for implementing BT was sought among the fleet of Fast Light Innovative Regional Trains (FLIRT) operated by the\n\nInternational Journal of Information Management 55 (2020) 102228\nRailway company. This choice was made after interviewing with Rail­ way company experts and the manufacturer of FLIRT rolling stock. These experts included asset managers, maintenance engineers, quality controllers/managers, warranty managers, and the Reliability, Avail­ ability, Maintainability, and Safety (RAMS) manager of the Railway company. Two of the most common problems reported by the in­ terviewees were the lack of provenance of Failure Mode and Effect Analyses (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analyses (FTA) and the inadequacy of maintenance instructions provided by the suppliers. This created mistrust between the rolling stock manufacturer and maintenance staff of the Railway company regarding the quality of maintenance per­ formed on rolling stock. The interviewees from both the manufacturer’s side and the Railway company side believed that adding provenance attributes to FMEA and FTA and analysing the adequacy of maintenance instructions could enhance trust in the maintenance performed. Together with asset managers and maintenance engineers at the Railway company and the warranty manager of the rolling stock manufacturer, a suitable use case for further investigation was explored within the FLIRT fleet.\nFLIRT was first introduced in the Netherlands in December 2016. Together with stakeholders from both sides, the specific failure that caused mistrust regarding FLIRT train maintenance was explored. In this regard, reported failures in FLIRT operation were analysed during the period 28-02-2018 to 28-05-2018. It is worth mentioning that failures, in this case, represent a delay in train operation of over three minutes, which is a standard performance indicator of the Railway company. Fig. 1 presents the failures reported in the given period.\nAs seen in Fig. 1, the most frequently reported failure is the unknown cause of delay. It is worth clarifying that this category represents situ­ ations in which the person reporting the failure could not identify the root cause of the delay or did not have enough information to charac­ terize the actual cause of delay. This is understandable, given the complexity of the situation and tight train timetables. Measures were being introduced to prevent such scenarios at the time this study was conducted. The second most common failure “Irrelevant cause of delay from maintenance perspective” is, as the name suggests, irrelevant for this study. As seen in Fig. 1, the third and fourth most frequently re­ ported failures comprised the brakes failing to release and the sliding step not moving backwards, respectively. Between these two, consul­ tation with the involved stakeholders showed that developing a block­ chain application for brakes failing to release faced political, ethical, and legal issues. More specifically, it would require train drivers to be willing to analyse their driving performance. This would have been challenging, given the organizational data protection rights of these train drivers. Therefore, seeing as the focus of the study was to show proof of concept and given the critical nature of sliding steps for FLIRT operation, the failure of the sliding step was eventually chosen as a use case for blockchain solution development.\n3. The solution: proof of concept\nSliding steps are part of the train door system that facilitates safe boarding. The purpose of the sliding step is to prevent passengers from falling or getting stuck between the train and the platform. The sliding step bridges the gap between the platform and the train by extending towards the platform from the bottom of the train door. Furthermore, sliding steps enable disabled people (especially those in a wheelchair) to board the train safely and easily. Each carriage of a FLIRT features four sliding steps, with two on each side of the carriage. The Railway com­ pany maintains 796 FLIRT-type sliding steps.\nThe definition of maintenance on the sliding steps is provided by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Based on contractual agree­ ments, the OEM provides a warranty for the rolling stock if it is main­ tained in accordance with its guidelines. Maintenance tasks are specified by the OEM and they require qualified personnel who can perform these tasks. Based on the criticality analysis, the OEM also provides a rough\n\n3\n\nY.

Reported failure (delay in train operation of over three minutes) FLIRT in the given period.\n\nmaintenance task schedule. Based on this schedule, the Railway com­ pany draws up a maintenance plan for maintaining its assets by taking into consideration the OEM’s guidelines, their existing knowledge about the asset, and their performance goals.\nAt the time of writing, FLIRT sliding steps were inspected and maintained every 90 days, coinciding with regular preventive mainte­ nance. This involved technicians cleaning and servicing the sliding steps, in accordance with the maintenance instructions provided by the OEM. If the sliding step fails while a train is in service or if it is defective during regular preventive maintenance, a separate work order is sub­ mitted in the maintenance management system. The system then schedules corrective maintenance for that sliding step and files a war­ ranty claim where applicable.\nThe fundamental problem with the current maintenance practices, besides the disruption they cause, is the lack of consensus on the quality of performed maintenance between the maintainer and warranty pro­ viders. Interviews conducted with warranty personnel of the OEM identified that they regarded the maintenance information recorded by the party that performed the maintenance to be inadequate or insuffi­ cient to verify the validity of the warranty claim. They seemed to claim that maintenance personnel of the Railway company did not service the sliding steps in accordance with their maintenance guidelines. The Railway company maintenance personnel stated that, despite following all the maintenance instructions given by the OEM, the sliding steps still failed prematurely and frequently. They claimed that the sliding steps, in their current state, fell short of the promised contractual reliability and availability commitments and that a redesign was perhaps needed. This situation created an environment of mistrust among the stake­ holders involved and resulted in a lack of consensus on the quality of performed maintenance. Therefore, there was a need for a solution that could facilitate consensus, build on the quality of performed\n\nmaintenance, and help enhance trust among stakeholders. Thanks to its unique features, BT is an excellent platform for such a solution. Conse­ quently, the explicit objectives for the desired blockchain-based solution were determined next.\n3.1. Objectives of the solutions\nAs stated previously, the desired solution had to help build consensus and enhance trust among the relevant stakeholders. It needed to be transparent and secure and have provenance features. First, the following goal was formulated for developing the required solution:\n“Developing a blockchain-based knowledge-sharing platform that can facilitate consensus building and enhance trust in the quality of maintenance performed on the FLIRT sliding step among stakeholders”\nTo specify explicit objectives for the desired solution, a storyboard, persona templates, and user stories were constructed. The designed storyboard which provides a graphical representation of the current and proposed approach for FLIRT sliding step maintenance registration is presented in Fig. 2.\nPersona templates are an established design technique within the ITdesign field designers use to understand the user perspective (Johansson & Messeter, 2005). Using persona templates is a common practice within the IT department of the Railway company. Personas were used to specify the objectives of the desired blockchain application. Relevant stakeholders were asked to fill in the designed persona template shown in Table 1.\nThe stakeholders who completed the template included the Railway company Quality Manager (QM)/Quality Controller (QC), technicians and Maintenance Engineers (ME), and the Warranty Manager (WM) and\n\n4\n\nY.

This provided a good sum­ mary of the needs of the key stakeholders responsible for the mainte­ nance of the sliding step. Similarly, to translate the user perspective into the developer’s perspective, user stories were formulated based on the completed persona templates. A user story is a brief narrative that de­ scribes a specific task of a single worker, and the corresponding situation (Ashbacher, 2010). The formulated user stories were completed in close consultation with the stakeholders who completed the persona tem­ plates to avoid any misunderstanding. These user stories and the cor­ responding requirements for the desired application were assigned the status of Minimal Viable Product (MVP) or optional, depending on their relevance for the stated goal. Considering that the study’s primary focus is to show proof of concept, only MVP requirements were taken into consideration in the design and development of the blockchain appli­ cation. The user stories formulated for this application are presented in Appendix A.\n\n3.2. Design and development\nA team of two IT developers, a business consultant, a test coordi­ nator, a maintenance engineer, and a researcher (first author) was\n\ncomposed for the design and development of the application. In addi­ tion, two experts from the security and validation department, and the IT-design department of the Railway company, were also regularly consulted during the design and development of the application. Weekly meetings were held to track the progress of the application development process and to facilitate communication among the members of the team. The initial code of the application, which includes the backbone of the Angular application and the smart contract code, was adopted from the GitHub repository of Simon Stone, who is a major maintainer of the Hyperledger composer at IBM. A more detailed description of the developed blockchain application can be accessed through the GitHub repository of Anouk van Gelder, named anouq/nst-app, one of the IT developers on the team. It is an open-source code that defines the asset structures, transactions, and events of the application written in the TypeScript programming language. A summary of key design and development aspects of the developed blockchain solution is provided next.\nThe front end of the prototype blockchain application was built with Angular 4, a popular JavaScript framework for building single-page applications. It was then deployed on permissioned Hyperledger Fab­ ric platform where consensus algorithms such as the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) work efficiently. PBFT is a voting-based consensus mechanism where transaction approval depends on the ma­ jority of approval nodes (Bodkhe et al., 2020). Using PBFT for devel­ oping blockchain solutions improves fault-tolerance and performance in case of aligned faults (Bodkhe et al., 2020). In a case study, Yusuf, Surjandari, and Rus (2019) deployed a blockchain-based network on the Hyperledger platform to solve the vegetables supplier’s problem, where supplier companies have a short time to finish the ledger. Their research showed that fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are more suitable and feasible for the vegetable supply chain (Yusuf et al., 2019). Similar to the vegetable supplier’s problem, a shorter time to achieve consensus on the quality of performed maintenance is crucial to maintaining operational\n\n5\n\nY. Abbas et al.\nreliability for the involved stakeholders. Androulaki et al. (2018) showed that Hyperledger Fabric can achieve an end-to-end throughput of over 3500 transactions per second with sub-second latency in certain configurations scaling well over 100 peers. Besides this, it provides the BT functionality, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) that enable developing smart contracts and end-user applications. Similarly, it supports interactional privacy, provable acceptances, effective adjudication, and trustworthy identifi­ cation as mentioned by Palm et al. (2020). These aspects made Hyper­ ledger Fabric a suitable fit for deploying the developed business logic. The information architecture of the deployed business logic is presented in Fig. 3.\nAs seen in Fig. 3, the Business Network Archive (BNA) defines the network model (assets, participants, and transactions), the business logic (the transaction functions), and the access control limitations. The BNA generates the Representational State Transfer (also known as REST) Application Program Interface (API). The application user interacts with the web application, written in Angular 4, based on the defined consensus protocol. Hyperledger Fabric uses execute-order-validate blockchain architecture instead of traditional order-execute architec­ ture which limits scalability and requires endorsement by all peers (Androulaki et al., 2018). In Hyperledger Fabric, transaction proposals are submitted by clients for execution, and peers execute and validate the transactions. Only the specified endorsing peers validate the trans­ actions according to the endorsement policy (ibid). Once all the mandated signatures are added to the transaction according to the endorsement policy, the transaction is appended to the distributed led­ ger by the ordering nodes (Palm et al., 2020). Validation rules can be customized in code as contracts to meet context-specific needs. For this study, Maintainers submitted the transactions as clients to the network, and WMs and QMs/QCs validated the transactions as endorsing peers. By specifying these node types, the Maintainer can submit and propa­ gate transactions (maintenance events), while WMs and QMs/QCs can execute and verify the transactions. Peer nodes in the Hyperledger Fabric can process multiple transactions simultaneously, allowing for greater efficiency and scalability. Similarly, by implementing the agreed-upon transactional details, ordering nodes can facilitate the creation of a single accurate record of transactions. These presented aspects of Hyperledger Fabric made it easier to deploy the developed BNA.\nIn terms of user interaction, the web clients interact with the REST API, which appends transactions to the blockchain state database. The\n\nInternational Journal of Information Management 55 (2020) 102228\nstate database records the current state of Hyperledger Fabric. The REST API can request existing transactions and send information on existing and new transactions to the blockchain state database. Hyperledger Fabric stores the current state in the state database, setting it apart from traditional blockchains such as Bitcoin. This makes Hyperledger faster and more efficient and enables the members of the network to query the stored transactions. The blockchain log of Hyperledger Fabric provides information on the provenance of assets, which is critical for building trust among the members of the network. As a result, Hyperledger Fabric allows the web client to return information from the REST API to the user quickly and efficiently.\nTransactional data play a key role in consensus-building on the quality of performed maintenance. The peer nodes of the network need to verify the quality of performed maintenance to reach consensus. Recognizing this, certain requirements were set for every maintenance event registration. For instance, the maintainer was required to upload photos of the maintenance performed and confirm that they had fol­ lowed the maintenance instructions. This would give the peer nodes access to necessary information, such as time, work order number, maintenance instructions, photos of performed maintenance. for each registered maintenance event. To ensure the indelibility of every transaction (i.e. registration of a maintenance event by a maintainer, validation by QM/QC, and by WM), an immutable transactional hash was generated and stored on Hyperledger Fabric. Fig. 4 presents the process flow of the developed application.\n3.3. Evaluation of the solution\nThe developed blockchain solution was tested in a workshop con­ ducted at a maintenance facility of the Railway company. The selected facility serviced the FLIRT fleet. The workshop was attended by tech­ nicians, QC/QM, and ME of the Railway company and by the WM and ME of the OEM. In this workshop, first, the underlying motivation and problem were presented to the attendees. This was followed by a detailed description of the purpose and functioning of the solution. The process flow of the solution was explained and a demonstration of registering and approving a maintenance event was given. Afterward, the attendees were given login credentials based on their roles and were encouraged to use the application for a few hours at the maintenance facility.\nThe application was then evaluated after a few hours of use through an online password-protected survey. The survey was specially designed\n\nFig. 3. The information architecture of the developed application. 6\n\nY. Abbas et al.\n\nInternational Journal of Information Management 55 (2020) 102228\n\nFig. 4. Process flow of the developed application.\n\nfor evaluating the performance of the developed solution in building trust in the quality of performed maintenance. A detailed overview of the survey questions is provided in Appendix B. The survey ensured anonymity, which enabled freedom to express one’s opinion freely in response to the questions asked in the survey. Results were compiled after recording the responses of 10 respondents. This included all key stakeholder roles responsible for the maintenance of the sliding steps namely the technicians (/maintainers), QM (/QC), ME of the Railway company and the OEM, and the WM of the OEM.\nThe analysis of the survey data showed that all respondents believed that the presented solution would increase trust and transparency in the quality of maintenance performed on sliding steps. Similarly, the survey data also showed that validation of maintenance activities by the rele­ vant stakeholders in a secure and immutable manner was considered an improvement in the maintenance registration system by nine out of ten respondents. This highlights the added value of BT in facilitating trustbuilding among the involved stakeholders thanks to its provenance and trust-building consensus algorithms. Similarly, nine out of ten re­ spondents reported that defined transactional data in the designed business logic was sufficient to analyse the quality of performed main­ tenance. The transactional data included photos of the performed maintenance, work order number, used maintenance instructions number, type of maintenance performed, and additional comments.\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) was calculated to evaluate the overall satisfaction of the stakeholders with the developed solution. NPS is an index ranging from -100 to 100 that measures the willingness of a customer to recommend a product or service (Reichheld, 2003). The respondents were asked to grade the presented solution on a 10-point scale based on their experience of using it for maintenance informa­ tion management of the sliding steps as shown in Appendix B. The NPS bar is traditionally classified into three categories, namely detractors, passives, and promoters (Reichheld, 2003). Respondents reporting a score from 0 to 6 are classified as detractors and are not considered to be passionate about the product. Respondents scoring the product with a 7 or 8 are classified as passives and considered to be somewhat satisfied with the product. Similarly, respondents score the product with a 9 or 10 are classified as promoters and are considered someone who would use and recommend the product to others. The final NPS score is determined by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters (Reichheld, 2003). For the developed solution, the final NPS score after analysing the scores of 10 respondents was evaluated to be -12.50. More specifically, 25 % of the respondents ended up as de­ tractors, 63 % as passives, and 13 % as promotors. This evaluated NPS score implies that the solution in its current form is not ready to be introduced in practice. Nonetheless, the results do imply the value of blockchain-led maintenance information management solutions in building trust among the involved stakeholders. Besides this, the feed­ back received in the evaluation phase on potential areas of improvement\n\nsuch as additional negotiation functionality and integration of different IT solutions being used for maintenance management can help in improving the solution and enhancing practical acceptability. It is worth mentioning that all the respondents reported once the identified con­ cerns in the feedback session are addressed, they are willing to use the developed solution in practice for maintenance information manage­ ment of the sliding steps.\n4. Discussion\nThis study has shown the value of BT in asset maintenance infor­ mation management, with major gains occurring in the form of increased trust in the quality of performed maintenance. The registered maintenance information on the IBM blockchain was largely accepted as true and reliable. The consensus-building on mutually agreed trans­ actional data and provenance features of the developed application facilitated the enhancement of trust among stakeholders. These findings complement the characterization of information as “Information-asthing”, “Information-as-process”, and “Information-as-knowledge” by Michael K Buckland (1991), who showed the phenomenon of stored information undergoing a process and resulting in the appropriate ac­ tion. The same phenomenon was observed in this study, where main­ tenance events that had been validated by stakeholders enhanced trust among those stakeholders. This can have a ripple effect, as it can help stakeholders develop an optimal maintenance plan for the assets and enhance asset performance in terms of reliability, availability, and maintainability by managing asset information using blockchain technology.\nThe developed solution provided reliable, secure, indelible, trans­ parent, and auditable information to stakeholders since the deployed business logic ensured that a maintenance event was authentic only if it had been validated by QM/QC and WM. The transactional data played a crucial role in consensus-building among stakeholders on the quality of performed maintenance, as it was defined in accordance with the needs and wishes of all stakeholders involved. The addition of 64-bit immu­ table hashes for all transactions provided transparency and made it possible for the solution to be monitored and audited. It meant that all the back-end users could verify the authenticity of a transaction by generating a hash and comparing it with the stored hash. Finally, the flexibility of the Boolean logic used for approving or rejecting registered maintenance events and the plugin for converting the stored information into another readable format ensured that the blockchain solution was more closely tailored to the needs of the stakeholders.\nThe study also shows that Hyperledger Fabric is a suitable blockchain platform for maintenance-related information systems. Features such as interactional privacy through the provision of subgroups, provable ac­ ceptances through endorsement policy, effective adjudication through customization of validation rules and trustworthy identification through\n\n7\n\nY. Abbas et al.\nthe provision of membership service, helped gain the trust of the involved stakeholders. However, one of the key limitations identified during the testing of the blockchain solution was the lack of room for negotiating terms in Hyperledger Fabric. For example, negotiating the quality of performed maintenance among involved stakeholders. Such functionality allows effective communication and timely amendments in the agreed business logic. However, Hyperledger Fabric does not pro­ vide this functionality on its own and the only possibility identified was to define the negotiating terms in the code as contracts. This implies that the code needs to be adjusted every time new negotiating terms are identified hindering the overall confidence and robustness of the solu­ tion. Besides this, considering the relatively small number of peer roles in the designed business logic, no significant latency issues were observed during the testing phase. The observed throughput rate was satisfactory for the presented maintenance status approval problem. Among other reasons, this is also because Hyperledger stores the current state in the state database and provides information on asset provenance through the blockchain log. However, for a comprehensive under­ standing of latency issues for the designed business logic, it should be tested with multiple clients, endorsing, and ordering nodes. Similarly, the scalability of the application was left out of the scope of this study, considering the limited user base and the study’s focus on demonstrating proof of concept. Nonetheless, the authors recommend running multiple instances of the server size application in docker containers before introducing the application in a production environment. This would allow developers to make distributed calls to different container in­ stances, enabling the application to be scaled easily and reducing the complexity of data sent by clients to the web server.\nLast, the survey results and discussion during the demonstration phase showed that certain points need to be addressed to enhance the acceptability of the developed solution in practice. For instance, addi­ tional functionalities, such as comment fields, should be provided for QM/QC and WM, so they can share their reason for approving or rejecting any specific maintenance event. Similarly, it was suggested that a rejected maintenance event should automatically trigger the submission of new work orders in the system to make the solution responsive to different conditions. On top of this, integrating the developed application with the current maintenance registration system was also suggested to close the maintenance management loop and enable easy importing and exporting of relevant maintenance informa­ tion across different systems. The above-mentioned points are a pre­ requisite for enhancing the acceptability of the developed solution in practice. The authors endorse these suggestions and would like to encourage future researchers to pay heed to these points for greater practical acceptability.\n5. Recommendation and implications\nThe findings from this research have important implications for the business of maintenance management, organisational information and knowledge management, and blockchain implementation research. The first implication generated by this research is that trust mechanisms assist in building trust in the quality of performed maintenance in a multi-stakeholder environment.\nSecond, technological solutions such as blockchain-based knowledge sharing platforms can be used for sharing critical asset information in a transparent and trustworthy manner. This not only enhances trust be­ tween stakeholders with different interests but also enables continuous improvements in business processes and facilitates further innovation of physical assets.\nThird, blockchain-led maintenance management is not discussed and researched enough in literature. With varying financial and organisa­ tional interests of the quality controllers and warranty managers, building consensus on the quality of performed maintenance can be a daunting task. Off-chain processes such as insertion of followed main­ tenance instructions, type of performed maintenance, photos of\n\nInternational Journal of Information Management 55 (2020) 102228\nperformed maintenance, and additional comments by the maintainer create a knowledge bank of the assets’ performance. This knowledge bank can be used in the future by the suppliers and asset users to improve their physical assets and fine-tune their asset requirements, respectively.\nFourth, the study shows the need for integrating different mainte­ nance management systems for successful implementation. While the study showed that trust in business can be achieved from permissioned blockchain adoption, long term organisational acceptability is linked with the integration of different maintenance management systems.\nFinally, an important implication is that fault-tolerant consensus algorithms are more suitable for maintenance information management. From the technical perspective, this is mainly due to their improved fault-tolerance, risk, and performance in case of aligned faults (Bodkhe et al., 2020). Similarly, from the business process perspective, this is mainly due to their suitability in situations where stakeholders have a short time to finish the ledger (Yusuf et al., 2019). The authors recom­ mend further testing of the fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for deploying maintenance management related business logic. Lastly, the authors also recommend further testing of organisational acceptability for blockchain-led maintenance management solutions after integrating them with contemporary maintenance management systems.\n6. Conclusion and future research\nThis study has attempted to bridge the gap between BT and main­ tenance information management. It reflected on the potential of BT in enhancing trust among the stakeholders responsible for the maintenance of rolling stock. A blockchain-based maintenance registration system was developed and deployed on IBM Hyperledger Fabric, a private permissioned blockchain network. More specifically, a maintenance event registration system was designed to analyse the quality of main­ tenance performed on the sliding step, a component of the train door system. The researchers collaborated with the Railway company, and the rolling stock manufacturer, to identify a practical case and test the developed approach. For this purpose, a survey was conducted to test the effectiveness of the developed solution. The results showed that the solution enhanced trust in the quality of performed maintenance among stakeholders. However, they also showed that the solution, in its current state, was not fully ready to be introduced in practice. The evaluation revealed that additional functionalities on front end application and integration of different IT systems being used for maintenance man­ agement are required for greater practical acceptability.\nOn the academic side, the study showed that at the level of proof of concept fault-tolerant consensus algorithms such as the one of Hyper­ ledger Fabric is more suitable and feasible for building trust on block­ chain led maintenance information management. The endorsement policy of the Hyperledger Fabric proved to be flexible enough to meet the needs of the identified problem of building trust in the quality of performed maintenance. Future research should test the designed business logic in practice with multiple clients and endorsing and ordering nodes. Similarly, further investigation into the scalability and latency issues of the developed business logic is also a key area of research. Finally, the chosen case was a litmus test to realize the po­ tential of BT in optimizing asset maintenance information management. With this study, the authors strive to nudge practitioners and academics towards blockchain-enabled maintenance.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nYawar Abbas: Conceptualization, Visualization, Methodology, Software, Investigation, Validation, Writing - original draft.
