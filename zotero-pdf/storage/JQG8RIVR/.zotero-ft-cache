Abstract

35

36

In this paper we review the dry port concept and its outfalls in terms of optimal

37

38

design and management of freight distribution. Some optimization challenges arising

39

from the presence of dry ports in intermodal freight transport systems are presented

40

and discussed. Then we consider the tactical planning problem of deﬁning the op-

41

42

timal routes and schedules for the ﬂeet of vehicles providing transportation services

43

between the terminals of a dry-port-based intermodal system. An original service net-

44

work design model based on a mixed integer programming mathematical formulation

45

46

is proposed to solve the considered problem. An experimental framework built upon

47

realistic instances inspired by regional cases is described and the computational results

48

of the model are presented and discussed.

1 Introduction

57

58

59

Current trends in maritime logistics often consider the presence of inland freight terminals

60 61

where consolidation of goods, custom services, information processing activities, short-

62

63

64

65

1

2

3

5

6

term storage and value-added manufacturing services for the containerized goods take

7

8

place before shipment toward the next destinations. In particular, dry ports are deﬁned

9

as inland freight terminals directly connected to one or more seaports with high-capacity

10

11

transport means, where customers can drop and pick up their standardised units as if di-

12

rectly at a seaport [34, 25]. The advantage of introducing one or more dry ports into freight

13

14

intermodal transport was conﬁrmed by several experiences in terms of logistics integra-

15

tion and port regionalization (e.g., [29, 33]). A signiﬁcant economic and political eﬀort is

16

17

currently being undertaken in many countries in order to extend as much as possible the

18

presence, number and suitability of dry ports, especially for the seaports located within

19

20

the area of congested cities. Despite this increasing interest in dry-port systems, the litera-

21

ture on freight logistics management [4, 11] shows a lack of contributions addressing those

22

23

optimization problems that arise from the corresponding freight distribution processes, at

24

a strategical, tactical and operational level.

25

26

The goal of this paper is to contribute to ﬁlling this gap, by introducing and describ-

27

ing the freight distribution systems based on the presence of dry ports from the point of

28

29

view of optimization challenges at diﬀerent levels, and then developing an optimization

30

approach for the speciﬁc problem of deﬁning tactical plans for these distribution systems.

31

32

The concurrent presence of high capacity connections among dry ports, seaports, and

33

other terminals, as well as congested road connections between terminals and inland cargo

34

35

shippers naturally yields a multi-tiered network representation, encompassing diﬀerent in-

36

frastructures and classes of vehicles.

37

38

First we present a comprehensive synthesis of the dry port concept as it is presented in

39

the recent literature on freight transportation, identifying and classifying the optimization

40

41

challenges supporting decisions in the ﬁeld of optimal design and management of dry-port-

42

based freight transportation systems.

43

44

Secondly, we consider the tactical planning problem consisting in the deﬁnition of the op-

45

timal schedule for the services operated by a ﬂeet of high-capacity vehicles, also referred

46

47

to as shuttles in the rest of the paper, on the railway network connecting seaport termi-

48

nals and dry ports, in order to address the requested demands of containerized cargoes.

49

50

An original service network design model representing the above mentioned tactical plan-

51

ning problem and based on a mixed integer programming mathematical formulation is

52

53

introduced. The speciﬁc features of the considered problem with respect to similar cases

54

previously presented in the literature for diﬀerent applications is discussed. In particular,

55

56

we consider the integration and consolidation on the vehicles of cargo ﬂows directed from

57

the shippers toward the seaports and vice versa, and the presence of diﬀerent classes of

58

59

products with diﬀerent types of associated administrative and operational requirements.

60

We adopt a time-space network representation for service network design problems which

61

62

63

2

64

65

1

2

3

4

5

6

represents a consolidated method in the scientiﬁc literature on network design (see for in-

7

8

stance [2, 32]). With respect to advanced approaches recently introduced in the literature

9

on service network design for freight logistics (see [1, 8, 9]), the model proposed in this

10

11

paper presents further elements of novelty related to the speciﬁc features of the considered

12

dry-port-based distribution problem, such as:

13

14

15

• the integration and consolidation on the same vehicles of cargo ﬂows directed from

16

17

the shippers toward the seaports and vice versa, together with the possibility to

18

model diﬀerent classes of administrative and operational requirements and opera-

19

20

tions through the calibration of cost parameters on the dummy arcs, particularly

21

relevant for the case of dry-port-based distribution optimization;

22

23

• the possibility to consider several candidate terminals (dry ports, seaports), in space

24

25

and time, for the pick-up or delivery of each cargo demands, thus leaving the model

26

decide which combination provides better results in terms of the overall logistics cost

27

28

function.

29

31

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a description of dry ports and their role

32

in the intermodal logistics of containerized goods is provided, together with a description

33

34

of related planning and decisional problems and optimization challenges. In Section 3 we

35

describe an optimization problem introduced to support the tactical planning process for

36

37

the services operated by a ﬂeet of high-capacity vehicles on the railway network connecting

38

the terminals. In Section 4 we propose an original service network design approach aimed

39

40

to model and solve the considered optimization problem. In Section 5 an experimental

41

framework built upon realistic instances inspired by regional cases is described and the

42

43

computational results of the model are presented and discussed. Conclusions complete the

44

paper.

2 Dry-port-based intermodal transportation

49

50

51

This Section starts by recalling the relevant role and evolution of the intermodal terminals

52 53

in freight transportation processes. In particular, the dry port concept is revised, em-

54

phasizing the speciﬁc features diﬀerentiating it from a simple inland freight terminal. In

55 56

the second part of the Section, optimization challenges related to the freight distribution

57

process in presence of dry ports are introduced and discussed.

2.1 Concept and role of dry-ports

7

8

9

Starting from the 1960s, the traﬃc of goods performed through standard containers yielded

10 11

a progressive increase in the importance and volumes of freight intermodal transportation.

12

With the following impressive increase in the quantities and values associated to freight

13 14

traﬃcs, several development processes took place, yielding to the expansion and special-

15

ization of seaports, the growth of the shipping industry and the empowerment of inland

16 17

logistics systems respectively, together with the progressive integration among these dif-

18

ferent components of the intermodal transportation system.

19 20

A fundamental consequence of the increase in the worldwide traﬃc of containers was a

21

growth in the number and size of the vessels operating for the maritime shipping of con-

22

tainerized cargoes. A lot of work was done for the expansion of the seaports capacity and

23

24

to increase the operational eﬃciency of the maritime terminals with respect to loading

25

and unloading operations and to the transshipment of freight in proximity of the seaports.

26

27

The growth in the traﬃc volumes arising from the development of seaports and maritime

28 29

shipping industry produced an increased level of congestion in the seaport zones due to

30

the uncontrolled increase in road transportation of containers, which caused in turn the

31

growth of transport times with its negative related economic fallouts, and a higher envi-

32

33

ronmental and social impact interesting the people living in the seaport areas.

34

Cullinane et al. describe in [14] the development of a seaport as the results of the interac-

35

36

tions among the economical system, the port system and the maritime shipping system:

37

the bottleneck of seaport facilities turns out to be the port storage capacity and accessi-

38

39

bility to the sea and the land side.

40

A basic feature in the recent freight distribution networks is represented by the presence

41

42

of logistics platforms, designed to receive freight and vehicles, provide short-term storage,

43

handling and consolidation, and allow the constitution of value-added loads to be shipped

44

45

through the next levels of the distribution networks, either to diﬀerent logistic hubs, or

46

to the respective ﬁnal customers. An advanced management of such operations, enabled

47

48

by the growing presence of technologies and information support systems, permits a more

49

eﬃcient use of the overall available transportation capacity, in terms of infrastructures,

50

51

ﬂeet, load capacity, and consequently a higher environmental and economic sustainability

52

of the activities related to the production and the consumption of goods.

53

54

The needs for such advanced logistics facilities yielded to the birth of dry ports as an

55

industrial reality as witnessed by the presence of several examples in the world (see [33]

56

57

for a review on several cases) much before its theoretical deﬁnition and placement within

58

the ﬁeld of research on transportation, that is still quite limited despite its industrial rel-

59

60

evance.

The initial introduction of the dry port concept is to be referred to the UNCTAD report

7

8

[39], where a dry port is deﬁned as an inland terminal to which shipping companies issue

9

their own import bills of lading for import cargoes assuming full responsibility of costs and

10

11

conditions and from which shipping companies issue their own bills of lading for export

12

cargoes.

13

14

A similar deﬁnition is provided in [23] where the value-added services component is em-

15

phasized as follows: a dry port is a port situated in the hinterland servicing an indus-

16

17

trial/commercial region connected with one or several ports by rail and/or road transport

18

and is oﬀering specialised services between the dry port and the transmarine destinations.

19

20

The description of the dry port concept and the deﬁnition provided in [25, 34] is often

21

considered in the scientiﬁc literature (see for instance [5, 14, 23]): here a dry port is

22

23

deﬁned as an inland terminal directly connected to the seaport(s) with high capacity trans-

24

port mean(s), where customers can leave/pick up their standardized units as if directly to

25

26

a seaport. For a recent update on these topics see also the Special Issue on The dry port

27

concept - Theory and practice in [13].

32

2.2 A classiﬁcation of dry-ports

33

34

35

The role of dry ports as an eﬀective interface for all the hinterland shippers needs imple-

36

ments the concept of extended gateway (see for instance [41]). According to the extended

37

38

gateway concept, the container storage and sorting function, together with custom and

39

other logistics value-added services, can be transferred from congested transhipment points

40

41

(seaports) to inland locations where more space is available. The connections between sea-

42

port and inland terminals are ensured by fast and reliable services, and hence these inland

43

44

sites can be considered as a real extension of the mainport (gateway). The main relevant

45

positive outfall of the extended gateway concept lies therefore in a substantial decrease in

46

47

the seaport zones congestion.

48

According to Notteboom et al. [29], dry ports can assume three main functions within

49

50

the transport chain: satellite terminal, load centers and transshipment facility. The dry

51

port concept and its role is classiﬁed in [34] starting from the location of the dry port

52

53

terminal with respect to the seaport and on the role that it consequently assumes within

54

the distribution system.

55

56

In Figure 1 an integrated logistics system based on the dry ports is depicted, which rep-

57

resents the fully implemented dry port concept described in [34], and is composed in this

58

59

case by two sea ports, two close dry ports, a midrange dry port and a distant dry port.

60

The distant dry port conﬁguration is the most common one: the dry port is located at

a long distance from the interested seaport(s), higher than 500 km. This situation is

18

19

associated to the maximum economies of scale for the railway operators and provides

20

high-capacity direct connections for a wide geographical area, typically interesting one or

21

22

more cities. Midrange dry ports are located within a distance from the seaport(s) that is

23

commonly covered by road transport (from 50 to 500 km) and are based on the presence

24

25

of additional railway connections towards conventional inland intermodal terminals. In

26

the close dry port conﬁguration, the dry port is located at a short distance (lower than

27

28

50 km) from a seaport, whose level of congestion is therefore strongly decreased. It can

29

consolidate the loads collected from and directed to the shippers that are located outside

30

31

the urban areas. This classiﬁcation is synthetically represented in Table 1, highlighting

32

the interdependence between the main functions performed in the transport chain by a dry

33

34

port (according to the classiﬁcation by Notteboom et al. [29]) and its physical distance

35

from the seaports (according to the classiﬁcation by Roso et al.[34]).

36

37

The presence of inland dry ports contributes to push the port development process to-

38

wards the regionalization phase, as described in [30]: functional interdependency and joint

39

40

development for a load centre and multimodal logistics platforms in its hinterland takes

41

place, until a regional load centre network emerges, thanks to a deep process of logistics

42

43

integration.

46

2.3 Optimizing dry port logistics: literature review and open issues

47

48

49

The increasing presence of advanced logistic platforms represents a recent and relevant

50

evolution trend in freight logistics, introducing the need to develop speciﬁc optimization

51

52

instruments and methods for planning and managing the distribution of goods on mul-

53

tilevel networks, characterized by hierarchical relationships and mutual inﬂuences among

54

55

the diﬀerent components of the freight distribution system.

56

The current scientiﬁc literature on freight logistics management presents a lack of contri-

57

58

butions addressing the optimization problems arising in dry port based freight distribution

59

processes. Therefore, in the following we introduce some of the optimization challenges

60

61

62

6

ports, for instance those based on mathematical programming and on the development

7

8

of exact and approximation algorithms to solve the arising optimization problems. For

9

instance, in [16] a Location-Allocation model is considered to optimize the conﬁguration

10

11

of a Seaport-Dry Port system, solved by a genetic approach.

12

Dry port location problems could be tackled also in consideration of the concurrent strate-

13

14

gical decisions concerning the design of the physical railway network connecting seaports,

15

dry ports and other inland intermodal terminals. The design of a dry-port-based distribu-

16

17

tion system poses therefore an optimization challenge in the direction of location-service

18

design problems. A speciﬁc focus on the cost-eﬃciency when introducing a dry-port sys-

19

20

tem in Finnish transportation network is proposed in [20] adopting a gravitational model

21

solved by integer linear programming.

22

23

The choices related to the design and implementation of a dry port system strongly inﬂu-

24

ence the future decisions of the customers, depending on their relative position with respect

25

26

to the seaport and dry port terminals, as discussed above (see the full implemented dry

27

port concept presented in [34] and depicted in Figure 1). As a consequence, the changes

28

29

in the conﬁguration of the shipping demand will have to be properly considered when

30

dealing with location and design optimization problems for the dry-port-based intermodal

31

32

transportation systems.

33

One more issue for the strategical planning process concerning dry ports falls in the class

34

35

of the facility layout design problem, in consideration of the speciﬁc nature of dry ports

36

and of the high and rich variety of diﬀerent classes of operations that must take place

37

38

in such inland logistics terminals, that should be properly considered in such a way to

39

optimize the ﬂows of containers and increase the level of eﬃciency. For a survey on this

40

41

class of optimization problems, one can refer to [15], while in [38] a focus on concurrent

42

optimization of size and location of public logistics terminals is considered.

43

44

45

46

47

Tactical level. On the tactical level, some decision problems arising from the presence of

48

49

dry ports in the distribution process concern the scheduling of the railway shuttle services,

50

the sizing of the operated shuttle ﬂeet, the deﬁnition of the routes for the shuttles, and

51

52

the level of integration of logistics services that can be implemented in a dry port in

53

order to maximize the positive impact for all the shareholders interested by the container

54

55

distribution process. There is still a lack of optimization contributions at this level, and

56

indeed this reason motivated our paper.

57

58

However, we recall a number of papers addressing tactical optimization problems in close

59

ﬁelds. In particular, for maritime transportation, a review on ship routing and scheduling

proposed in [7]. A speciﬁc contribution on Service Design models for railway intermodal

21

22

transportation is given in [10] while in [26] a general ferry service network design problem

23

is faced.

24

25

26 27

Operational level. A rich set of short term decisions can be considered as an optimiza-

28

tion issue for all of the diﬀerent types of operations that must be correctly managed in a

29 30

dry port, such as loading and unloading operations, transshipment of containers, detailed

31

vehicles and resource scheduling, custom clearance and inspection, safety procedures, re-

32 33

pair of containers, inventory management. More complex problems arise from the need to

34

schedule concurrently transportation services and short term storage and handling activi-

35 36

ties (see [3] for a review on inventory routing problems). Among the optimization problems

37

at this level, we mention the berth allocation problem, faced in [18], [19] and [22], while

38 39

berth scheduling is studied in [24] and [31]. Optimization of container terminal operations

40

is widely treated in the literature, see for instance [11], [37] and [42] for a review on this

41 42

topic. More in particular, container storage and transshipment in maritime terminals is

43

treated in [28], and a model to optimize the container logistics in the port-hinterland is

44 45

considered in [21]. For the problem of dynamic crane scheduling, a modiﬁed Lagrangean

46

relaxation method is applied to ﬁnd solutions of a MIP formulation in [44].

3 Problem setting

52

53

54

The speciﬁc aim of this paper is the study of methods for the optimal planning, at a tac-

55

56

tical level, of transportation processes on multi-tiered dry-port-based intermodal systems.

57

Tactical planning problems in the ﬁeld of freight transportation are commonly focused on

58

59

the need for consolidation processes, aiming to build eﬃcient transportation plans taking

60

concurrently into account the quality of the delivery service and the variability of the

61

62

63

9

64

65

1

2

3

4

5

6

demand. We assume the perspective of the shuttle service operator aiming to minimize

7

8

the overall logistics costs while satisfying the requested transportation demand.

9

In some cases, more than one operator could provide services on the same physical network.

10

11

Nevertheless, dry port systems, also because of their role as custom service providers, are

12

commonly settled and managed as an initiative of public port authorities, ensuring the

13

14

requested integration and coordination of the activities provided by possibly diﬀerent ser-

15

vice operators. Indeed, the idea of public logistics terminals is also motivated by the traﬃc

16

17

congestion and social and environmental costs which are not the main objectives where

18

the eﬀorts of private service operators are focused. This concept, seen as a multi-company

19

20

distribution center, should be seen not as a restriction to the economic distribution activi-

21

ties of private service enterprises in a very competitive market, rather to oﬀer coordinated

22

23

services allowing the whole system (oﬀered public services and private activities) to be

24

globally and economically eﬃcient. This approach has been followed, for instance in [38]

25

26

for public logistic platforms in the Kyoto-Osaka area in Japan. For these reasons, also for

27

the case of multiple service operators, tactical planning can be still thought and modeled

28

29

as an integrated process performed by a single decision maker.

30

We consider the problem of deﬁning the optimal schedule for the services operated by a

31

32

ﬂeet of high-capacity shuttles on the railway network connecting seaport terminals and dry

33

ports, in order to address the requested demands of containerized cargoes transportation.

34

35

The aim is to support the tactical planning process for the considered shuttle services, by

36

deﬁning and optimizing the working plans to be repeated on a daily or weekly basis, in

37

38

such a way to satisfy most of the regular demand. The time horizon considered in the

39

optimization problem must be therefore deﬁned and calibrated on the base of the expected

40

41

intensity of the traﬃc and its variations.

42

The problem encompasses the concurrent presence on the same services of two types of

43

44

cargo ﬂows: those generated by the movement of containers from inland shippers to the

45

seaports through the dry ports, and those arising from the containers unloaded from ships

46

47

at the seaports that are sent to the inland destinations through the dry ports.

48

We assume that a set of cargo demands are available, each of them being associated to

49

50

the loading or unloading operation at a ﬁxed seaport at a certain time instant. Moreover,

51

each cargo must be collected from (or delivered to) a certain inland shipper (or consignee)

52

53

within a time window that is part of the input of our problem.

54

We are particularly interested in those more complex cases in which the integrated logis-

55

56

tics network includes more than one seaport and more than one dry port, as depicted in

57

Figure 1. Solving the problem on simpler networks becomes then straightforward.

58

59

It follows that, in general, each cargo demand must be assigned to a dry port that is not

60

ﬁxed a priori, since more than one dry port could be suitable for the shipment. In Figure

e. The dwell times costs (such as demurrage and inventory costs);

20

21

f. The costs associated to value-added services, custom clearance, security inspection.

22

23

24

The optimization problem we consider must therefore support the deﬁnition of complete

25

tactical plans with detailed information on the following decisions:

26

27

28

Q1. The selection of services: which services must be operated on the base of the set of

29

demands and the size of the shuttle ﬂeet;

30

31

32

Q2. The assignment of cargo demands to the operated services: to which service each

33

cargo demand will be assigned;

34

35

Q3. The quantity of cargo demand associated with each operated service;

36

37

38

Q4. The routes on which services will be oﬀered: operated services are associated with

39

a sequence of physical terminals to be served by the shuttles;

40

41 42

Q5. The time schedule of the operated services: at what time instant the shuttle provid-

43

ing a service arrives to a terminal and leaves from the terminal;

44

45

Q6. The operations to be performed at each seaport and dry port terminal, in particular

46

47

with respect to cargo loading and unloading operations;

48

49

Q7. Which dry port will be assigned to each cargo demand among the set of suitable

50 51

terminals.

52

53

On the base of the output of the optimization problem we consider, a tactical plan will be

54

55

built, according to which every cargo demand is assigned exactly to a given service and to

56

a certain dry port among the suitable ones, while minimizing the overall logistics costs.

modal transportation

9

10

11

Service network design (SND) is increasingly used to model tactical planning processes in

12

13

which the selection and scheduling of the services to operate, the routing of the scheduled

14

service and of the cargoes, and the speciﬁcation of the terminal operations to be performed

15

16

must be decided (see [12] for a wide review of these class of problems).

17

In this Section we present an original SND model designed to represent the problem

18

19

described above.

20

21

22

Nodes. The description of the model starts by considering the set of physical nodes that

23

24

compose the system, and coincides with the set of sea ports and dry ports included in the

25

integrated logistics network. It is represented by the square and triangle nodes in Figure

26

27

2.

28

According to the description presented in the last Section, time is a fundamental element

29

30

for the considered problem, hence we deﬁne a time expanded network in which the set of

31

physical nodes of the logistics system is expanded over a given discrete time horizon as

32

33

illustrated in Figure 3.

34

Since the planning of road cargo transportation between the terminals and the customers

35

36

(shippers and consignees) is not included in the considered problem, customers are not

37

represented individually as network nodes, but a single dummy node γ is introduced

38

39

instead as a concurrent super-sink and super-source for all ﬂows associated to the cargo

40

demands. Therefore, the set of nodes of the network, denoted by N , is composed by:

41

42

43

• a node representing each seaport for each time instant of the considered time horizon.

44

45

• a node representing each dry port for each time instant of the considered time hori-

46

47

zon.

48

49

• a dummy node γ on which all the cargo demands are collapsed.

50

51

52

53

Arcs. The set of arcs A of the time-space network G = (N , A) is composed of three

54

55

subsets of arcs, namely:

56

57

• the movement arcs AM that connect nodes representing diﬀerent terminals, and

58

59

represent possible shuttle physical movements.

• the holding arcs AH that link couples of nodes representing the same terminal at

32

33

diﬀerent time periods and are used to model the loading and unloading of cargo.

34

Shuttles can hold at terminals only for the time strictly needed to load and unload

35

36

containers.

37

38

• the dummy arcs AD linking the nodes to γ. In particular, for each node i in the time

39 40

expanded network, two dummy arcs (γ, i) and (i, γ) are introduced.

41

42

Moreover, for each node i, we deﬁne the set N +(i) = {j ∈ N : (i, j) ∈ A} of successor

43 44

nodes and the set N −(i) = {j ∈ N : (j, i) ∈ A} of predecessor nodes. Similarly, N H+(i) =

45

{j ∈ N : (i, j) ∈ AH} and N H−(i) = {j ∈ N : (j, i) ∈ AH} assume the same meaning

46

47

limited to the subset of holding arcs.

48

49

50

Cargo demands. Deﬁne the set of cargo demands d ∈ D: each customer is associated

51 52

to a demand d that is characterized by a number of containers w(d), a given time instant

53

and a seaport terminal where the cargo shipment has its origin or destination, and a set

54 55

of candidate dry ports, together with the time window for the delivery (or the pick-up)

56

of the cargo. One of the main function of the dummy node γ and the dummy arcs AD

57 58

is devoted to the mathematical modelling representation of these elements, as depicted in

59

Figure 4. In the picture, the cargo ﬂow must be directed from a given seaport to a set of

60 61

candidate dry ports. In this case, the nodes representing the candidate dry ports during

Figure 4: Network representation for a given cargo demand directed from a given seaport

30

node to a set of candidate dry port nodes, represented in black. Only the dummy arcs

31

linking the suitable terminal nodes to the super-sink γ are represented.

32

33

34

the feasible time window are represented in black. Only the suitable dummy arcs linking

35

36

the latter nodes to the super-sink γ are represented. Similarly, only the node representing

37

the suitable seaport at the proper time instant for the loading of the cargo on the service

38

39

shuttle is black, and there is only one dummy arc connecting such a node to the super-

40

source γ. The use of all the remaining unsuitable dummy arcs is forbidden for that speciﬁc

41

42

cargo demand by associating to them a huge cost M .

43

A symmetrical network representation can be adopted for those cases in which the cargo

44

45

ﬂow is directed in the opposite direction, namely, from a set of candidate dry ports to a

46

given seaport.

47

48

Note that the costs associated to the arcs are diﬀerentiated on the base of the service and

49

the demand they refer to, as described in detail in the following.

50

51

The total quantity of goods related to each cargo demand is assumed to be shipped on a

52

single shuttle, in order to reduce the eﬀort required by the administrative and information

53

54

processing tasks.

55

In order to complete the description of the elements of the proposed SND model, two

56

57

deﬁnitions must be introduced to describe shuttle movements.

58

59

60

Service leg. A service leg is deﬁned as the activity performed by a shuttle from one

61

62

63

15

64

65

1

2

3

4

5

6

node to a diﬀerent one in the time-expanded network. These nodes can be the

7

8

time-expanded representation of two diﬀerent physical nodes when the service leg

9

is the transportation service operated by a shuttle between two diﬀerent terminals.

10

11

This ﬁrst class of activities is represented by the set AM of movement arcs already

12

introduced in the network deﬁnition. Otherwise, the two nodes could represent the

13

14

time-expanded representation of the same physical node at two distinct time instants,

15

and in that case the service leg represents the shuttle holding at the associated

16

17

physical terminal in order to perform loading and unloading services. This second

18

class of activities is represented by the set AH of holding arcs introduced above.

19

20

21

Schedule. The schedule associated to each of the operating shuttles is represented by a

22

single tour passing through the dummy node and composed of consecutive service

23

24

legs. The tour touches a ﬁnite number of nodes in the time-expanded network,

25

representing the shuttle servicing the associated terminal at the corresponding time

26

27

instant. In Figure 5 an example of schedule is illustrated: the dummy arc between

28

γ and the seaport node labelled 1 represents the start of the tour from the seaport,

29

30

where loading operations take place, represented by the service leg (1, 2). It follows

31

the service leg (2, 3) representing the movement of the shuttle toward a ﬁrst dry port

32

33

terminal where loading/unloading operations are performed (service leg (3, 4)) before

34

moving, through the service leg (4, 5), and reach a second dry port terminal. After

35

36

the loading/unloading operations at the second dry port are performed, represented

37

by the service leg (5, 6), a new service leg (6, 7) brings the shuttle again to the

38

39

seaport, where ﬁnal unloading operations are performed (service leg (7, 8)) before

40

the end of the tour, that is represented by the last (dummy) arc towards γ.

41

42

43

44

Shuttles. Consider the set R = {r} of available shuttles, with cardinality |R|. Each

45

46

shuttle is assumed to consist in a locomotive plus a certain number of ﬂat-cars carrying

47

the containers [40]. The sum of the capacities of the ﬂat-cars provides the capacity of each

48

49

shuttle r ∈ R, denoted by ur, while πi equals the maximum number of shuttles that can

50

concurrently stop to load or unload at terminal i ∈ N .

51

52

53 54

Costs. Three sets of cost coeﬃcients are considered in the model: a set of ﬁxed costs fr

55

for each shuttle r ∈ R, representing the class a of shuttle operating costs in the problem

56 57

setting description, a set of service-leg costs kijr associated with the service leg (i, j) being

58

operated by shuttle r, representing the class b of costs in the problem setting description,

59 60

and a set of variable costs cdijr associated with each container of cargo d from node i to

39 40

The variable costs cdijr permits to represent all the remaining classes of costs presented in

41

the problem setting description in a properly diﬀerentiated way, depending on the types

42

43

of arcs, demands and shuttle they refer to.

44

Variable costs associated to movement arcs. The costs for moving the containers of a given

45 46

cargo demand (class c of costs in the problem setting description) can be represented by

47

considering the cost coeﬃcients on the movement arcs {cdijr} ∀(i, j) ∈ AM , r ∈ R, d ∈ D.

48

49

Variable costs associated to holding arcs. The costs for loading and unloading the contain-

50

ers of a given cargo demand (class d of costs in the problem setting description) can be

51 52

modelled by calibrating the cost coeﬃcients on the holding arcs {cdijr} ∀(i, j) ∈ AH , r ∈

53

R, d ∈ D.

54 55

Variable costs associated to dummy arcs. We recall as feasible dry ports, sea ports and

56

time instants for the loading and unloading of each cargo demand are considered in our

57 58

model by properly setting the costs for the dummy arcs associated to each demand and

59

service, that is, {cdijr} ∀(i, j) ∈ AD, r ∈ R, d ∈ D. All the unfeasible ﬂow assignments for

60

1

2

3

4

5

6

a given demand are excluded forbidding the use of the related dummy arcs by setting the

7

8

cost as equal to M in the parameter set. Anyway, the presence of costs on dummy arcs is

9

associated to a second main function in our model, namely, that of representing the costs

10

11

of type e and f in the problem setting description for all those ﬂow assignments that are

12

not forbidden. This way, it is possible to diﬀerentiate such costs depending on the shuttle,

13

14

on the class of product, on the physical terminal and on the time instant they refer to.

15

16

17

18

19

Variables. For each available shuttle r ∈ R, we introduce a binary variable φr assuming

20

a value equal to 1 if shuttle r is operated, and 0 otherwise; a set of service design variables

21

22

yijr, (i, j) ∈ A, deﬁning the service legs associated to shuttle r: yijr assumes a value equal

23

to 1 if service leg (i, j) is operated by shuttle r, and 0 otherwise; a set of binary variables

24 25

zrd, d ∈ D, assuming a value equal to 1 if the cargo demand d is shipped through shuttle r,

26 27

and 0 otherwise, xdijr, (i, j) ∈ A, d ∈ D, being the corresponding ﬂow variables representing

28

the amount of containers of cargo demand d carried by shuttle r along the service leg (i, j).

29

With respect to the problem setting presented in Section 3, decision Q1 is associated with

30 31

variables φr, details on Q2 are provided by variables zrd, while decisions Q3 are associated

32

with variables xdijr. Finally, service design variables yijr deﬁne decisions Q4, Q5, Q6 and

33

34

Q7.

Mathematical formulation. The objective function aims at the minimization of the

52 53

overall cost. Constraints (2) and (3) ensure the conservation of cargo ﬂows at nodes

54

and the satisfaction of the cargo demands, together with constraints (4) assigning each

55 56

cargo demand to exactly one shuttle. A single unsplit circular route passing through

57

the γ node is ensured by constraints (5) and (6). Constraints (7) activate service legs

58

and impose limits on the amount of cargo on each leg, while constraints (8) forbid, for

59

60

each period in the time horizon, the presence of more than one service leg on the same

physical connection. Recalling that two nodes i and j ∈ N H+(i) represent the same

7

8

physical node in diﬀerent time periods, relations (9) and (10) are introduced to force the

9

shuttles to wait at terminals for the time required to perform the unloading and loading

10

11

operations, respectively. Constraints (11) impose limits on the number of shuttles that can

12

simultaneously be at a terminal. The proposed arc-based formulation for the considered

13

14

service network design problem falls into the class of capacitated multicommodity ﬁxed

15

charge network design problems (CMND), which are known to be N P -hard [2]. However,

16

17

this mathematical formulation is solvable for realistic instances as will be seen in Section

18

5.2.

5 Proof of concept for the proposed modeling approach

23

24

25

The purpose of this Section is to perform a computational test for the model proposed

26

27

previously in order to verify its correctness and suitability to solve the tactical optimiza-

28

tion problem introduced in Section 3. The ﬁrst aim is to provide a proof of concept for the

29

30

optimization model and its features. Secondly, we want to check the scalability in terms

31

of the computational eﬀort required to solve the model and provide eﬃcient solutions for

32

33

the freight transportation tactical planning process in presence of dry ports. Third, we

34

want to investigate the possibility to solve instances inspired to those complex and realis-

35

36

tic cases in which more than one dry port and more than one seaport are present in the

37

logistics system. To this aim, the testbed for the computational test is inspired on the

38

39

relevant case of the italian northern logistics platform, in which the presence of a dry port

40

for the city of Alessandria was considered by the authorities in the last years.

41

42

43

45

5.1 Description of the testbed and computational framework

46

47

48

The objective of the Alessandria dry port project is the realization of a large interport

49

hub directly connected to the seaports of Genoa, Savona and La Spezia, in order to in-

50

51

crease the potential for development of the ligurian ports with respect to the Northern

52

and Central Italy and enable a strong recovery of competitiveness compared to other ports

53

54

of the Mediterranean and Northern Europe [36, 35]. The interventions are intended to

55

facilitate the de-congestion of the ligurian seaports, allow a greater operability and inte-

56

57

grate activities with the development of port logistics value-added services, as well as the

58

establishment of new enterprises and a growth in the logistics and transport employment.

59

this case due to the presence of three seaports as well as of the Rivalta Scrivia dry port

35

already operating in the region.

36

37

The testbed for the computational test was built under the hypothesis that the overall

38

logistics network is composed of ﬁve physical nodes, that is, three ligurian seaports: Genoa

39

40

(GEN ), Savona (SAV ) and La Spezia (SP E), and two dry ports in the region of Piemonte:

41

Alessandria (ALE) and Rivalta Scrivia (RIV ). The set of physical nodes considered in

42

43

the testbed is represented in Figure 6, obtained by means of a Geographical Information

44

System implemented within the free open source Quantum Gis (http://www.qgis.org/)

45

46

environment. We assume direct railway connections exist between each seaport and the

47

two dry ports, and between the two dry ports. The set of physical movement arcs is

48

49

reported in Table 3 in which the tail and head of each arc is expressed through the code

50

name of the related node, and the length, expressed in km, is computed starting from the

51

52

geographical coordinates of the nodes in the GIS system. In the testbed we assume a mean

53

speed for the shuttles of 60 km/h while the number of time steps required for performing

54

55

the movement is equal to the integer approximation of the physical distance divided by

56

the product of the mean shuttle speed times the length of the time interval.

57

58

An example of graphical representation of the time expanded network is depicted in

59

60

Figure 7. In this example we assume a discrete time interval of two hours. Since the

Table 3: List of the physical movement arcs for the considered logistics network.

21

22

23

Alessandria dry port logistics system is planned to work on a 24 hours-a-day basis, the

24

time expanded representation of the network is obtained by exploding the set of physical

25

26

nodes on a time horizon composed by 13 time instants and 12 time intervals, starting from

27

the time instant 0 until the time instant 12. The meaning of the nodes representation is

28

29

provided in Table 4 where each node presented in Figure 7 is described according to the

30

following classiﬁcation: type=0 if the node represents a seaport (GEN , SAV , SP E), while

31

32

type=1 if the node represents a dry port (ALE, RIV ).

33

34

In this case the set of arcs is composed by 144 movement arcs, 60 holding arcs and

35

130 dummy arcs linking the nodes of the time expanded network to the additional dummy

36

37

node γ, which is represented by node 66 in Figure 7.

38

39

The testbed for the computational experiments is composed by four sets of instances

40

based on the framework above described representing the Alessandria dry port logistics

41

42

system. We considered four diﬀerent values for the time step parameter deﬁning the

43

number of time intervals in which the 24 hours time horizon is divided. The ﬁrst set

44

45

of instances is based on a time step equal to 120 minutes, corresponding to 12 time

46

intervals and 13 time instants, namely t = 0, t = 1, ..., t = 12. The time step for the

47

48

second set of instances equals 90 minutes, giving rise to 16 time intervals and 17 time

49

instants, namely t = 0, t = 1, ..., t = 16. The third set of instances is based on a time

50

51

step equal to 60 minutes, that corresponds to 24 time intervals and 25 time instants, with

52

t = 0, t = 1, ..., t = 24. Finally, the fourth set of instances has a time step of 45 minutes,

53 54

with 32 associated time intervals and 33 time instants, namely t = 0, t = 1, ..., t = 32.

55

A description of the time expanded network associated with the four sets of instances in

56

57

terms of number of nodes and diﬀerent classes of arcs is presented in Table 5.

58 59

We considered four sets of instances and 5 demand scenarios for each set, with an

60

increasing number of cargo demands ranging from 20 to 100. A total number of 20 problem

Table 5: Description of the time expanded network for each set of instances.

15

instances was generated. The size w(d) associated to each cargo demand d ∈ D was set at

16 17

pseudorandom with a uniform distribution in the range 1, ..., 5 TEUs. Each cargo demand

18

was associated to a seaport at pseudorandom with a uniform distribution among those

19 20

available, and the geographical location of the customer was set at pseudorandom as well.

21

The available ﬂeet was considered as composed of 2 shuttles, each one with a maximum

22 23

load parameter ur equal to 50 TEUs. The cost fr associated with the activation of a

24

shuttle was ﬁxed to 100000, while the ﬁxed cost for the activation of each service leg was

25 26

set equal to 1000. Concerning the variable costs, the parameters {cdijr} were set to 10 for

27

the transportation of each unit of cargo between two diﬀerent terminals (movement arcs).

28 29

The variable costs associated to the holding arcs are supposed to include the handling

30

costs, and therefore were set at pseudorandom with a uniform distribution in the range

31 32

1, ..., 50. The variable costs associated to the dummy arcs linking the dry port nodes to

33

the dummy node γ in both directions represent the costs for dwell times and value-added

34 35

services at terminals, and were set at pseudorandom with a uniform distribution in the

36

range 1, ..., 100.

37 38

An optimization code was designed and written in ANSI C++ language in order to load

39

and process the instances, build the time expanded networks and create and solve the

40 41

associated model by recalling the IBM ILOG Cplex 12.6 libraries.

42

The following Cplex parameters and settings were considered. The chosen optimization

43 44

algorithm was the Branch and Cut algorithm with a ﬁnal time limit of 12 hours of CPU

45

time, also providing intermediate results after 6, 8 and 10 hours of CPU time. MIP

46 47

emphasis was set to balance optimality and feasibility, the MIP search method was set to

48

dynamic search with 20 parallel running threads.

49 50

All the experiments were performed on a workstation with an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v2

51

@ 2.80GHz, 64 Gb of RAM and running Linux Ubuntu 14.04 64 bits as operating system.

5.2 Analysis of the computational results

55

56

57

The numerical results of the computational experiments are shown in Table 6, while in

58

Figure 8 an example of schedule for the two available shuttles is reported, representing the

59

60

computational results obtained from an instance with 12 time intervals. The dashed line

64

65

3

4

5

6

represents the schedule for shuttle 1 while the solid line represents the schedule for shuttle

7

8

2. The structure of the schedules obtained from the computational results conﬁrms the

9

correctness and the suitability of the model to provide solutions for the tactical optimiza-

10

11

tion problem introduced in Section 3. In particular, the ﬁrst shuttle is associated with the

12

following schedule: Savona seaport - Rivalta dry port - Genoa seaport - Alessandria dry

13

14

port - La Spezia seaport. Between each couple of terminals, holdover arcs are correctly

15

activated in order to permit the required loading/unloading operations, as requested by

16

17

the model. Similarly, the schedule associated to the second shuttle according to the re-

18

sults is as follows: Alessandria dry port - Genoa seaport - Alessandria dry port - Savona

19

20

dry port - Rivalta dry port - Genoa seaport. Also in this schedule the required holdover

21

arcs are correctly activated by the model at each schedule leg to represent the associated

22

23

loading/unloading operations.

24

The above described schedules provide an example of the proof of concept obtained through

25

26

the computational experiments performed on a set of instances based on realistic case stud-

27

ies and validating the original model presented in the previous Section.

28

29

With respect to the quality of the computational results, a feasible solution is found by

30

the solver for all the considered instances within the time limit of 6 hours. Additional

31

32

CPU time enables better results in most cases, but the diﬀerence is often very limited, in

33

particular for those instances with a higher number of cargo demands.

34

35

Optimal solutions are obtained for instances with a limited number of cargo demands for

36

the ﬁrst two sets of instances. Higher quantities of cargo demands increase considerably

37

38

the computational eﬀort required to solve the instances, as conﬁrmed by an increase in

39

the values of the optimality GAP and the decrease in the number of analysed nodes in

40

41

the search tree. Shorter time steps correspond to a growth in the number of intervals for

42

the considered time horizon and therefore in the number of binary variables. A related

43

44

increase in the required computational eﬀort can be observed in the results, in particular

45

for large size instances where the number of analysed nodes in the search tree is reduced.

46

47

On smaller instances, a more dense time resolution permits sometimes to ﬁnd better so-

48

lutions in terms of objective function value and optimality GAP, since the available time

49

50

horizon can be exploited in a more ﬂexible and eﬃcient way.

51

More in general, the results obtained from the computational test conﬁrm the suitability of

52

53

the proposed model for practical purposes, even in the case of a complex dry port logistics

54

system.

The results of the computational test conﬁrmed the correctness and suitability of the pro-

10

11

posed service network design model and good quality feasible solutions were produced for

12

the considered tactical planning problem on realistic instances within a limited amount of

13
